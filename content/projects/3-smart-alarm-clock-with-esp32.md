## Assembly Steps

### 1. Hardware Connection

Firstly, connect all hardware components according to the provided schematic. This includes connecting the LED matrix module, rotary encoder, buzzer, and other sensors to the ESP32 development board.

### 2. Software Setup

Use the Arduino IDE to install the required library files and download the code ZIP file, ensuring all feature files and the main file are in the same folder so they can be opened as tabs in the IDE. The required open-source code addresses are:

- [Adafruit-GFX-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)
- [arduino-Max72xxPanel](https://github.com/markruys/arduino-Max72xxPanel)
- [RotaryEncoder](https://github.com/mathertel/RotaryEncoder)
- [ESPUI](https://github.com/s00500/ESPUI)

### 3. Code Adjustment

Based on your own hardware setup, you will need to search for `@EB-setup` comments in the code to adjust the hardware pins and other settings. If you need to modify the default settings, you can search for `@EB-custom` comments.

### 4. Network Interface Configuration

Upon startup, the alarm clock will attempt to read the WiFi configuration from the EEPROM and connect to the network. If there are no stored settings, or if the network name or password has changed, it will create a hotspot for you to enter new settings, which will then be saved to the EEPROM.

### 5. Web Interface Usage

After connecting to the network created by the ESP32, you can access the web interface to configure the alarm clock, including setting the time, alarms, display modes, etc.

## Debugging and Testing

Once your hardware and software are ready, ensure thorough testing to verify all functions of the alarm clock. Check the network connection, responsiveness of the web interface, accuracy of sensor readings, and reliability of the alarm functions.

## Conclusion

Through this tutorial, you will not only be able to create a multifunctional smart alarm clock but also learn the basics of ESP32, including hardware interfaces, network programming, and sensor integration. This project is not only an interesting DIY activity but also brings convenience and fun to your daily life.
