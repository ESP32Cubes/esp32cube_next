#### GitHub Repository:
[TRMNL Firmware on GitHub](https://github.com/usetrmnl/trmnl-firmware)

#### API Documentation:
[TRMNL API Docs](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/how-it-works)

The firmware, API documentation, and power consumption measurement details are all open-sourced. The API documentation site provides more detailed explanations of the firmware and software design. Essentially, the system works by implementing communication between the client and server, where the TRMNL firmware sends requests to the server for content, plugins, or firmware updates.

### Plugins and Customization
The server hosts a collection of native and custom plugins. TRMNL plugins can display RSS feeds, show photo slideshows, weather updates, Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet balances, Outlook or Google calendars, Hacker News feeds, shopping lists, and more. Currently, there are 82 plugins available (as shown below).
