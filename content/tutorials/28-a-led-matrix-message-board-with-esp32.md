# A LED Matrix Message Board with ESP32

This project is an LED matrix message board based on the ESP32 microcontroller. It is capable of connecting to the network and displaying real-time news, weather, stock, date, time, and barometric pressure data. It also supports menu and web interfaces, as well as notification functions. The LED matrix modules display information in a set format on the screen, allowing users to conveniently access various types of information.

# Features and Characteristics

The LED matrix message board has the following features and characteristics:

- **Time and Data Display**: It connects to local WiFi networks and time servers to obtain local date and time, and can also determine if daylight saving time is in effect, ensuring users always receive accurate time information.
- **Display Areas**: The message board has three display areas for time, alternating date and barometric pressure information, and the main information display, allowing users to quickly access different types of information at a glance.
- **Interactive Control**: Users can use a rotary encoder to select menu items, such as the main rotation, various news categories, or stock data, offering a user-friendly interaction method.
- **Web Interface**: The LED matrix message board can display custom messages and perform control operations through a web interface, including sending messages and triggering the buzzer to produce notification sounds.
