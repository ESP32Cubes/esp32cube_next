Neko asked me how to flash IO pin configure to ESP32 on Youtube. In this article, I will introduce how to configure ESP32 by a file.

We can use ESP32 SPIFFS to store and read the configure file. SPIFFS (SPI Flash File System) allows you to use the flash memory of the ESP32 to store files, providing a way to read and write data in a structured manner similar to how files are managed on a traditional file system.

To save the ESP32 configuration file to a.txt file and be able to upload it to the ESP32, follow these steps:

1. Create a Configuration File.
2. Add code in ESP32 program to read the configuration file.
3. Include or upload the configuration file to the ESP32 by PlatformIO.

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Create the Configuration File

Create a file named `config.txt` and include the following content:

```txt
PIN_LED=2
PIN_BUTTON=4
```

### Step 2: Write ESP32 Code to Read the Configuration File
In your ESP32 code, add the code to read the configuration file and parse its content. For example:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <FS.h>
#include <SPIFFS.h>

int pinLED;
int pinButton;

void readConfigFile() {
    if(!SPIFFS.begin(true)){
        Serial.println("An error has occurred while mounting SPIFFS");
        return;
    }

    File file = SPIFFS.open("/config.txt", "r");
    if(!file){
        Serial.println("Failed to open file for reading");
        return;
    }

    while(file.available()){
        String line = file.readStringUntil('\n');
        int separatorIndex = line.indexOf('=');
        if (separatorIndex == -1) continue;

        String key = line.substring(0, separatorIndex);
        String value = line.substring(separatorIndex + 1);

        if (key == "PIN_LED") {
            pinLED = value.toInt();
        } else if (key == "PIN_BUTTON") {
            pinButton = value.toInt();
        }
    }
    file.close();
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);

    readConfigFile();

    pinMode(pinLED, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(pinButton, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
    // Your main code here
}
```

In this example, it reads the content in `config.txt`, and splits each row string to pin define. You can change the code how to deal with the content as you need.

### Step 3: Upload the Configuration File 

Then we can upload/flash the configure file to ESP32 during PlatformIO flash code, or upload it at any time as needed.

In the root directory of your PlatformIO project, create a folder named `data` and place the `config.txt` file inside it.

Add SPIFFS support in the `platformio.ini` file:

```ini
[env:esp32]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 115200
build_flags =
    -D CONFIG_SPIFFS_SIZE=1500000
```

Then flash code to ESP32 by the tools at the bottom toolbar. Or the side tools on the left panel.

![[0399750bf425b99248a104a2e5155f0d_MD5.png]]

The first one `Upload` is upload compiled codes, the second one `Upload Filessystem Image` will upload files under the data folder to ESP32 SPIFFS.

Or use the following command to upload the SPIFFS file system:

```sh
pio run --target uploadfs
```
